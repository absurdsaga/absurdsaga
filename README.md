# Absurd Saga

Absurd Saga is an experimental absurdist RPG developed by Rich McGrew, with a simple, intuitive user interface aimed at accessibility and ease of use for all types of players.

This game project aims to eliminate as many obstacles as possible to having fun, and be widely available for free on as many platforms as possible for everyone. Annoyances being avoided include microtransactions, ads, requiring a constant Internet connection, being pay to win, needing to create an account and password, being a buggy mess that crashes, excessive grinding, inventory management, timed events, a confusingly complicated user interface, and parts of the game where you get stuck and need a walkthrough.

It is a free and open-source cross-platform game, based on the excellent [Ren'Py game engine](https://www.renpy.org/). Contributions, improvements, translations, and ports to other platforms will all be very welcome on this GitHub, once this project is complete enough to upload here.

Code and text are under the [MIT License](LICENSE), and images and music will be under other free licenses (details to be announced later once the game is more complete). The game in its present state, while playable, is currently far too short and incomplete to post here just yet. It will be here once it is ready for the public. Stay tuned.
